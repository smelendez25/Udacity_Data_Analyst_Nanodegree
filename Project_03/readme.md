A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that we get some practice working with the difficulties of these

For this project, I have worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to work through this  to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
